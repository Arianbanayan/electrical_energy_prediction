# electrical_energy_prediction
Build an ANN Regression model to predict the electrical energy output of a Combined Cycle Power Plant And add Tkinter Gui for get input from user


Given the dataset with four features: Ambient Temperature (AT), Vacuum (V), Ambient Pressure (AP), and Relative Humidity (RH).with this features our model predicts the net hourly electrical energy output (EP) of the plant using available hourly average ambient variables.


pr file is for create Gui and some codes for creating .exe file with pyinstaller package


energy prediction file is code for training model and save model(.keras)file 

.xlsx is the dataset 

 .keras file is trained model file that we use for creating gui
